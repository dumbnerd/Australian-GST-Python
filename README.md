# Australian-GST-Python

This python script shows Australian GST (10%) amount in dollars and cents from an amount that includes GST.

I made this so it would be faster to write tax invoices with the proper gst amount. 

....But the real reason i made this was to stop myself raging on stupid calculators and throwing them at the wall.
!!! I HAVE ONE CALCULATOR THAT WORKS AND EVEN THAT DOESNT ROUND .00 !!!

Now myself and staff can do gst cash sales with the proper amounts.

Basic USE:
- Download (australin-gst.py)
- Open the computers terminal and go to the folder where file was saved.
- Run command  
	python australian-gst.py
- The terminal will then ask you to enter the amount that is including gst. [press enter]
- Now see the terminal has the GST amount displayed in dollars and cents


* I'll make a gui/app for you to run this on your phone and you can stop taking my calculator. :P

* I would like to add customer payment method and set rounding .00 cents if payment is cash.
	eg Total incGST = $13.88
		rounding = + .02 cents
		Total [CASH] payment needed = $13.90
	+ or - ....meh i dont know i have not spent any time looking at the maths :D
